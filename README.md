New Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek V3.2 Exp, Gemini 2.5 Flash 09-2025 and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite 09-2025 models have been released. I wanted to test them for code analysis for my csfa.sh nftables wrapper script and GitHub workflow action test against other LLM models I use. This is for code analysis and not code generation. Code analysis would be useful for understanding code bases, writing documentation, troubleshooting code and planning.

> CSFA (v1.3.1) is a CSF-like wrapper for nftables that provides familiar ConfigServer Security & Firewall commands mapped to modern nftables equivalents. The project uses a single Bash script (`csfa.sh`) that manages firewall rules through a dedicated inet table called "csfa".

I have paid subscriptions and accounts with:

* OpenAI ChatGPT Plus
* Claude AI Max $100
* Gemini AI Pro
* T3 Chat
* OpenRouter AI
* KiloCode

I tested 23 AI LLM models for code analysis and summaries and then used Claude Code Sonnet 4.5 to evaluate and rank all 23 AI LLM model responses.
